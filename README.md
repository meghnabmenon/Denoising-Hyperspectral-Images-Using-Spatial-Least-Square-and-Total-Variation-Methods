# Denoising-Hyperspectral-Images-Using-Spatial-Least-Square-and-Total-Variation-Methods
Hyperspectral Imaging is one of the new found techniques where it uses hundreds of images at different wavelengths for the given same spatial area. The main goal of this technique is to obtain the spectrum for each of the pixels, with the purpose of finding objects, monitoring processes etc. In this project, we were asked to denoise some bands of the hyperspectral image using methods like the Least Square and Total Variation. After the denoising has been done, a comparative analysis was done to deduce which of the two denoising methods gave us better results based on the Signal to Noise ratio.
